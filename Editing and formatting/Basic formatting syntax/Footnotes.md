You can add `footnotes` [^Hikaru]Â to your notes using the following syntax:

[^Hikaru]: This is a named footnote. 

```md
This is a simple footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the referenced text.
[^2]: Add 2 spaces at the start of each new line.
  This lets you write footnotes that span multiple lines.
[^Hikaru]: Named footnotes still appear as numbers, but can make it easier to identify and link references.
```

You can also inline footnotes in a sentence. Note that the caret goes outside the brackets:

You can also use `inline footnotes.` ^[This is an inline footnote.]

Note
Inline footnotes only work in reading view, not in Live Preview.
