You can add images with external URLs, by adding a `!` symbol before an [external link](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#External%20links).

```md
![Engelbart](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)
```

![Engelbart](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)

You can change the image dimensions, by adding `|640x480` to the link destination, where 640 is the width and 480 is the height.

```md
![Engelbart|100x145](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)
```

If you only specify the width, the image scales according to its original aspect ratio. For example:

```md
![Engelbart|100](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)
```

Tip

If you want to add an image from inside your vault, you can also [embed an image in a note](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embed+files#Embed%20an%20image%20in%20a%20note).
